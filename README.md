# pandas-challenge2
Please note: I broke my original pandas-challenge repository and do not know how to fix it. 

Please note also: this is my 2nd submission for this challenge original one is in https://github.com/Evkn00/pandas-challenge but I renamed some files and managed to mismerge. 

Main.ipynb is now my 2nd submission.
OLD(MAIN).ipynb is the first submission
All other info below remains accurate. 

I fixed a previous error where I had used ">" instead of ">=" and then on the advice of ASKBCS I fixed the column names which weren't exactly the same as the instructions. This took a long time and I had to refactor a lot of the code. Now its not as pretty, but it works and the numbers are correct.
